Change of Basis for vectors, matrices, quaternions, and Euler Angles

Just put the two source files: changeOfBasis.h, changeOfBasis.cpp into your project.
I have only compiled them under MS Dev Studio 2010 but they are very simple and could be
modified for other compilers and even other languages like Java and C#.

The code was generated from other code not included in this project.  First I worked out
the patterns in wxMaxima, which is a symbolic math tool.  Then I wrote the code generators
in C++.  Some tests are included but I also tested it against math code that I don't have
redistribution rights.  So of course that code is not included either.
